# Assignment 3: Tool

## About the Tool:

Q: State the problem / claim that your tool is solving.

A: The goal of our tool is to reduce unnecessary costs and construction delays, by calculating the volume of concrete, which is used for the columns of the building and gathering these information in tabels. This helps planing the construction process, as needed materials can be ordered in a more efficient and sustainabale way, preventing space- and material-waste on the construction site. Additionally the construction workers can be used more sensible and efficient makting the overall construction process quicker.

Q: State where you found that problem.

A: The problem occours in the planing phase of the building, on the construction site and when ordering materials for the construction, in this case concrete.

Q: Description of the tool

A: The tool takes the data for the height and cross section of the columns from the ifc-file and calculates the concrete volume for each individual column. These information is then collected and sorted in Tables, which make it possible to search for the volume of each individual column, all columns of one floor, and all columns of the building.

Q: Instructions to run the tool.

A: 
1. save an ifc.file to your harddrive
2. input the ifc filepath in the relevant code line (follow the instructions inside the code)
3. run the code
4. receive information from the tool
5. cross-check values, if necessary
6. use information to solve the problem e.g. costing, planning

## Advanced Building Design:

Q: What Advanced Building Design Stage (A,B,C or D) would your tool be usefuL?

A: stage B (design) and C (build)

Q: Which subjects might use it?

A: structural design, economic and environmental evaluation, construction management 

Q: What information is required in the model for your tool to work?

A:
1. globally unique identifier (GUID)
2. location of columns (Floor)
3. geometry of columns
