Q: Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended:

A:

At the beginning of this course, my familiarity with OpenBIM concepts and tools like IfcOpenShell was minimal. I lacked practical experience in analyzing IFC files or understanding the potential of open-source BIM workflows. By the end of the course, I had significantly improved, becoming proficient in using Python and IfcOpenShell to analyze IFC files and develop tools to extract and calculate data such as volumes of elements. Additionally, teaching my peers solidified my understanding and gave me confidence in applying OpenBIM principles practically.

Level at End: 

Q: What else do you still need to learn?

A: I still need to deepen my understanding of advanced OpenBIM workflows, particularly in automating data analysis across large-scale projects. Additionally, mastering more complex Python coding techniques, advanced geometry calculations, and integrating OpenBIM tools with other software like Blender or Dynamo could further enhance my skill set. Gaining insight into industry best practices for implementing OpenBIM in real-world projects would also be valuable.

Q: How you might use OpenBIM in the future?

A: OpenBIM provides the foundation for transparent and interoperable workflows. In the future, I plan to use OpenBIM to improve collaboration in multidisciplinary projects by leveraging its interoperability to streamline communication and data exchange. Custom tools developed with IfcOpenShell could optimize project management by analyzing models efficiently. Additionally, OpenBIM's flexibility could be instrumental in sustainable design and facility management, where accurate data is crucial for lifecycle assessment and optimization.

## Your process of developing the tutorial

Q: Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?

A: Although I am not pursuing a thesis, the course helped me define practical questions I will encounter in professional practice. For instance, how to optimize workflows for analyzing IFC data and how to use OpenBIM tools for project interoperability. These are critical questions that I plan to address through continuous learning and implementation in practice.

Q: Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?

A: No, the range of use cases was valuable as it allowed flexibility to focus on areas of personal or professional interest. Having options to explore both geometry analysis and volume calculations enabled me to tailor the learning experience to my goals.

Q: Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?

A:The number of tools was appropriate. Tools like IfcOpenShell, Python, and Blender offered a solid foundation for OpenBIM workflows. I wouldnâ€™t recommend removing any, but adding more advanced tools, such as Dynamo or Revit integrations, could further enhance practical application in industry settings.

## (Individual) Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

Q: Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?

A: While I am not doing a thesis, I intend to apply OpenBIM tools in practice. The skills I developed, such as analyzing IFC files and creating custom tools, are directly applicable to collaborative projects and efficiency in professional workflows.

Q: Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?

A: Yes. OpenBIM aligns with the growing emphasis on transparency and collaboration in the industry. Over the next decade, I plan to integrate OpenBIM tools into project workflows to improve data management, facilitate team collaboration, and contribute to sustainable and efficient building processes.

## (Individual) Wrap up

Q: conclude the journey through A1-A5

A: The journey from A1 to A5 was transformative. Starting with basic concepts, I progressively developed hands-on skills in OpenBIM tools, Python coding, and IFC analysis. Creating a peer tutorial was a good milestone, reinforcing my new knowledge while improving communication skills. The process not only deepened my technical expertise but also built confidence in using pyhton and OpenBIM tools in practical scenarios. This experience has equipped me with valuable skills and insights that I am eager to apply in my professional career.
