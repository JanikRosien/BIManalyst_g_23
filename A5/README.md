# Reflection Hugh Fulton ()

Q: Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended:

A:

At the beginning of this course, my familiarity with OpenBIM concepts and tools like IfcOpenShell was minimal. I lacked practical experience in analyzing IFC files or understanding the potential of open-source BIM workflows. By the end of the course, I had significantly improved, becoming confident in using Python and IfcOpenShell to analyze IFC files and develop tools to extract and calculate data such as volumes of elements. the tutorial exercise also helped my understanding and gave me confidence in applying OpenBIM principles practically.

Q: What else do you still need to learn?

A: I still need to deepen my understanding of advanced OpenBIM workflows, especially in automating data analysis across large-scale projects. Learning more complex Python coding techniques, advanced geometry calculations, and integrating OpenBIM tools with other software like Blender or Dynamo could further enhance my skill set. Gaining more insight into industry best practices for implementing OpenBIM in real-world projects would also be valuable.

Q: How you might use OpenBIM in the future?

A: In the future, I would like to use OpenBIM to improve collaboration in multidisciplinary projects by utilising its streamlined communication and data exchange. Custom tools developed with IfcOpenShell could optimize project management by analyzing models efficiently.

## Your process of developing the tutorial

Q: Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?

A: Although I am not pursuing a thesis, the course helped me define practical questions I will encounter in professional practice. e.g. how to optimize workflows for analyzing IFC data and how to use OpenBIM tools for project interoperability. These are questions that I plan to address through continuous learning and implementation in practice.

Q: Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?

A: No, the range of use cases was valuable as it allowed flexibility to focus on areas of personal or professional interest. Having options to explore both geometry analysis and volume calculations enabled me to tailor the learning experience to my goals.

Q: Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?

A:The number of tools was appropriate. Tools like IfcOpenShell, Python, and Blender offered a foundation for OpenBIM workflows. I wouldnâ€™t recommend removing any, but adding more advanced tools, such as Dynamo or Revit integrations, could enhance practical application in industry settings.

## (Individual) Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

Q: Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?

A: While I am not doing a thesis, I intend to apply OpenBIM tools in practice. The skills I developed, such as analyzing IFC files and creating custom tools, are directly applicable to collaborative projects and efficiency in professional workflows.

Q: Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?

A: Yes. OpenBIM aligns with the growing emphasis on transparency and collaboration in the industry. I plan to integrate OpenBIM tools into project workflows to improve data management, facilitate team collaboration, and contribute to sustainable and efficient building processes.

## (Individual) Wrap up

Q: conclude the journey through A1-A5

A: The journey from A1 to A5 was enlightening. Starting with basic concepts, I progressively developed hands-on skills in OpenBIM tools, Python coding, and IFC analysis. Creating a peer tutorial was a good milestone, reinforcing my knowledge while improving communication skills. The process helped develop technical expertise and built confidence in using pyhton and OpenBIM tools in practical scenarios. This experience has equipped me with skills and insights that I am eager to apply in my professional career.

# Reflection Freancesco Levizzani (s241900)

Q: Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended:

A: At the beginnign of the course my level of knowledge about BIM was confined in the tasks I could do in Revit files and extrapolating data from there, I didn't know anything about coding nor IFC files. In the end my knowledge about BIM growth in both theory and prectice: handling IFC files without a graphical interface was though at the beginning but made me realize how many more things we can do with those files.
Level at Start
Level at End

Q: What else do you still need to learn?

A: For sure my Python code skills can massively improve, as well as my understanding of the IFC workflow

Q: How you might use OpenBIM in the future?

A: Automizing structural calculation and feedbacks between drawing and spreadsheets

## (Individual) Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

Q: Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?

A: I still have no idea in which field will be my thesis so it's hard to tell. But I wouldn't exclude use the kwnowledge got in this course if they come to be usefull

Q: Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?

A: I think OpenBIM tools will be an essencial part of my professional future

## (Individual) Wrap up

Q: conclude the journey through A1-A5

A: When I started this course I was afraid for my poor skills in coding, but surprisengly I discoverded how helpfull and fun can create tools that help in so many different tasks, especially related to the building area. The deep learning started immediatly in the first three assignments where the code learning reached his peak, later on other skills where more involved, as communicating skills as well as understanding things in other ways to express them better to others. I think that the multiple check and reports helped me in the way of growing my knowledge.

# (As a group) summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial

Q: Did the tool address the use case you identified?

A: Yes, the tool addressed the identified use case effectively. Our tutorial on using the create.geom function demonstrated a method to calculate volumes for elements lacking volume attributes, like beams, columns, slabs. Feedback confirmed that this approach was innovative and filled a practical gap, especially for later stages of the building process where such attributes may be absent. While the method worked well for standard geometries, there was constructive feedback on potential inaccuracies for non-orthogonal objects and the need for additional outputs (e.g., combining Global IDs with volumes) to enhance usability in broader workflows. Overall, the tool aligned well with the intended purpose and was positively received.
